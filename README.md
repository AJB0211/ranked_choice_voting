# ranked_choice_voting

Naive implementation of ranked choice voting in Python.
Implementation is wholly functional with Python list comprehensions.
But this is Python so it's bad functional programming.

Only import is `Counter` from `collections`

## This has not been bug tested at all, unclear if it even works.
